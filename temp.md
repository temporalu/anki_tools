# 我们希望的释义（HTML）

<div class="entry"><h3 style="color: rgb(255, 56, 60);">adjective</h3><ol><li>having life:<ul><li><b>animate being</b> Cities are not animate beings, but their inhabitants are.</li><li>What is at issue here is the freightage of goods, both animate and inanimate.</li></ul></li></ol></div><div class="entry"><h3 style="color: rgb(255, 56, 60);">verb</h3><ol><li>to make someone seem more happy or active:<ul><li>A sparkle in his eyes animated his face whenever he smiled.</li></ul></li><li>to cause someone or something to be more active or full of life:<ul><li>He knows exactly what to say to animate a crowd.</li></ul></li></ol></div>

# 区别
注意到我们希望的释义中，animate being被加粗了。
原因是animate being是这个例句的核心。因为有这个核心所以有这个例句。
